# Hi there! 👋

I'm **Reman Alamoudi**, a **Junior Software Engineering student at Jeddah University**.  
I enjoy creating **clean, functional, and aesthetically pleasing front-end projects** with thoughtful **UX/UI design**.

## About Me

Besides front-end development, I am exploring **back-end development** and enjoy learning through hands-on projects.  
I am motivated to **grow my skills, experiment, and improve** through trial and error.
